# python311
To run data cleaning and analysis, original 311 data file is needed. Because of its size it is not possible to store it in git hub. When running the code locally, please download 311 database from: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9/data
Then: Run data_cleaning_rent.ipynb, followed by data_cleaning_analysis_311.ipynb
